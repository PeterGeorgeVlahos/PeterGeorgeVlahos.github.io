  <h2>Words Winston, Words Alone Wont Save the World</h2>

    <h3>In his 90 years as a soldier, journalist, prolific author, politician and statesman during the first half of the 20th century, Winston Churchill had many opportunities to influence world events, and while opinions on his various successes and failures can be steeply divided, his was a hard-won wisdom, which he expressed with great pith and wit.

      Being a natural statesman, and a great writer to boot, he was very good at putting that wisdom to use, and there are so many quotable examples from his various speeches and public comments that it's easy to compile a list of his most inspirational thoughts, the ones that would apply to a multitude of situations, to be issued on Winston Churchill Day (which is April 9).</h3>
